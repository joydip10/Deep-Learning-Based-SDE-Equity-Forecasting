# Learning Adaptive Wiener Processes for Market-Driven Equity Forecasting through Deep Learning SDE Parameter Estimation

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the source code and implementation details for the research paper *"Learning Adaptive Wiener Processes for Market-Driven Equity Forecasting through Deep Learning SDE Parameter Estimation."*

Traditional financial modeling often relies on Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) with constant drift and volatility parameters, which fails in real-world markets characterized by non-stationarity and regime shifts. This project introduces a **Physics-Informed Hybrid Architecture** that combines **Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)** with **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.

Instead of predicting stock prices directly, the model uses a custom Wiener Process-based Loss Function to dynamically estimate time-varying **Drift ($\mu$)** and **Volatility ($\sigma$)** parameters of the underlying Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE), enhancing generalizability across asset classes and volatility regimes.

## 🛠️ Code Description & Methodology

### 1. Hybrid Physics-Informed Models

Located in `LSTM_based_implementation.ipynb` and `GRU_based_implementation.ipynb`.  

- **Input:** Look-back window of historical scaled prices ($T=120$)  
- **Architecture:**  
  - **Encoder:** DenseKAN layer with learnable B-spline activations for non-linear feature extraction  
  - **Decoder:** RNN (LSTM or GRU) capturing temporal dependencies  
  - **Output:** Two neurons representing instantaneous Drift ($\mu$) and Log-Volatility ($\log \sigma$)  
- **Loss Function:** Custom Wiener Loss simulating the next price step using GBM:  
  $$
  S_{t+1} = S_t \cdot \exp(\mu - 0.5\sigma^2 + \sigma Z)
  $$  
  Optimizes $\mu$ and $\sigma$ to maximize likelihood of observed prices

### 2. Baseline Models

Standalone models trained with conventional Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss:

- `KAN.ipynb`: Stacked Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (non-linear, no recurrence)  
- `LSTM.ipynb`: Standard LSTM network  
- `GRU.ipynb`: Standard GRU network  

### 3. Statistical Analysis

`Stock_Analysis/statistical_analysis.ipynb` contains scripts to:

- Compute descriptive statistics (mean, std dev, skewness, kurtosis)  
- Visualize 120-day rolling volatility to illustrate market regime shifts  
- Analyze return distributions across sectors
